## 🧠 How It Works

1. User opens the app in a browser.  
2. UI renders data or interactive components based on the feature set.  
3. User can interact with visual elements or inputs.  
4. App responds instantly thanks to Vite’s fast refresh and optimized build.

_(Add a short feature bullet list here once specifics are clear — e.g., “AI responses, graph visualizations, timeline interactions.”)_
